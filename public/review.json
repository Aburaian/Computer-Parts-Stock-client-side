Seller connects through video call to resolve the issue. This is my first refurbished purchase, but I am happy with its performance.",

Core i5 processor clearly an asset at this price range and has already showed in terms of its performance and speed. I am a multi tasker and would be running several processes/ programmes at any given time and am happy with the performance.",
